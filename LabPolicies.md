### Lab Usage

The activities taking place in the lab shall be prioritized in the following order:

1. UC CubeCats Activities such as meetings and work sessions
2. Academic activities such as members studying
3. Non CubeCats sanctioned recreational activities such as video games, movies, and tv shows

### Item Checkout

Item Checkout is defined as the authorized removal of any UC CubeCats property outside of the lab space, including all instances where property is transported from one lab space to another.

The following policies must be adhered to for any item checkout event:

* Any checkout of an item owned by the UC CubeCats or the University of Cincinnati must recorded using the forms available on the UC CubeCats github repository.
* A member of the secretary team shall be notified within 24 hours of an item checkout by the responsible party.
* Items shall be due back to the lab they originated from within two weeks of the checkout day, unless under special circumstances designated by the Secretary team.
* Items valued more than $100 are restricted from checkout unless members get written or electronic permission from the Secretary beforehand.

In failure to comply with the above, the member may have their checkout privileges revoked by a majority vote of Executive Board and in extreme circumstances may be restricted from lab access.

### Property Damage

All lab items must be treated with caution and proper care. Checked out items must be returned in the same condition as they were when checked out.

In failure to comply with the above, members may have to replace the item or reimburse the property owner the estimated cost of the item. In the event a lab item is mistakenly damaged through responsible usage, it shall be replaced or repaired using UC CubeCats funds.

* Notify the Secretary team if the trash can is full and be responsibly clean with waste management during such events

* Clean up any messes or spills that result from their activities
* Do not leave any dirty dishes or other unsanitary items in the lab

In failure to comply with the above, members or their associates may be ordinated to clean the unsanitary conditions resulting from their misconduct and in extreme cases may be restricted from certain lab activities or access.

At the end of the semester the lab shall be thoroughly cleaned and the refrigerator emptied by the Secretary team.
